In this game, there're squares that fall from the screen. The objective is to select the correct kind of number according to it's value.
For example, if the number in the square is even, the player must select the "even" button.
For each righ selection, 10 points are added to the score, but if the selection is wrong, the player loses the same amount.

If there's a prime number, it's worthy 100 points. A prime number selected as odd is worthy 10 points.
The game speed ("gravity") increases while the players get more points. Once a square disapears from the screen, it doesn't come back.
The game is over when all the 3 squares disapears.
This game can be used for teaching childs the basic about numbers and it's properties.
